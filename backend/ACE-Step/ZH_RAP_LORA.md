# üé§ RapMachine Release

We meticulously curated and trained this model on Chinese rap/hip-hop datasets, with rigorous data cleaning and recaptioning. The results include:  
- **Improved pronunciation** for Chinese lyrics  
- **Enhanced adherence** to hip-hop and electronic music styles  
- **Greater diversity** in hip-hop vocal performances  

### **How to Use**  
1. Generate **higher-quality Chinese songs**  (‚ö†Ô∏è It's not just for Chinese songs. You can also use it in other ways. )

2. Create **better hip-hop tracks**  
3. Blend it with other genres to:  
   - Produce music with **richer vocal details**  
   - Experiment with **underground or street culture flavors**  
4. Fine-tune outputs using the following dimensions:  

    - **`vocal_timbre`**: Describes the inherent qualities of the voice.

## Community Note
We‚Äôve **revamped and expanded** the LoRA training guide with finer details. This release is a **proof of concept**‚Äîshowcasing the potential of **ACE-Step**.

While a Chinese rap LoRA might seem niche for non-Chinese communities, we consistently demonstrate through such projects that ACE-step - as a music generation foundation model - holds boundless potential. It doesn't just improve pronunciation in one language, but spawns new styles. 

The universal human appreciation of music is a precious asset. Like abstract LEGO blocks, these elements will eventually combine in more organic ways. May our open-source contributions propel the evolution of musical history forward.

**Enjoy it, customize it, and create something entirely new.** 

We can‚Äôt wait to hear what you‚Äôll build!
