    "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIn a world so grand he roams the skies alone\nHis heart a heavy stone a tale untold\nWhispers of his past echo through the night\nA lonely dragon searching for the light\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce a mighty force now he drifts in pain\nHis scales once shimmered now they're dark with shame\nCast out by his kin in shadows he does hide\nA haunting sorrow burns deep inside\n\n[Chorus]\nRoaming endless fields with no friend in sight\nHis roar a mournful cry beneath the moon's pale light\nTears fall like stars as he flies on his way\nA lonely dragon yearning for the break of day\n\n[Bridge]\nThe world turns cold the nights grow long\nIn his heart he carries an ancient song\nOf battles fought and love long gone\nA legend now but his soul is torn\n\n[Verse 3]\nHoping for a day he'll find a kindred soul\nTo share his pain and make him whole\nTill then he drifts a shadow in the sky\nA lonely dragon with tears in his eye\n\n[Chorus]\nRoaming endless fields with no friend in sight\nHis roar a mournful cry beneath the moon's pale light\nTears fall like stars as he flies on his way\nA lonely dragon yearning for the break of day",
